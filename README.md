# CHAMELEON — starter repo

This is the scaffolding for your engine. It handles input loading, output
writing, rendering, and Docker packaging — so the only file you need to
edit is **`engine/resize.py`**.

```
input:  a task JSON (source design + target canvas)
              |
              v
        engine/resize.py   <-- YOU IMPLEMENT THIS
              |
              v
output: <task>_output.json  (schema-valid resized design)
        <task>_output.png   (rendered preview)
```

Both the JSON and the PNG are what get evaluated — see `RULES.md`.



## Repo layout

```
engine/
  resize.py        <- implement your approach here
  main.py           <- orchestrator (input -> resize() -> output). Don't need to edit this.
renderer/           <- the real renderer (transformer-convertor + cr-renderer), already vendored
brand_kit/
  assets/           <- image files referenced by asset_id in the sample designs
  fonts/            <- font files matching the schema's font_family values
input/               <- drop task JSON files here for local testing (3 samples included)
output/              <- results land here
chameleon_design_schema_v0.9.json   <- full field-by-field spec for the design format
Dockerfile
RULES.md
```

## Quick start (no Docker needed for iterating on `resize()`)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m engine.main
```

This processes every `*.json` file in `input/` (the 3 sample designs are
already there — one per difficulty level) and writes an `_output.json` and
`_output.png` for each into `output/`.

The engine preserves the **Level 1 proportional layout** for simple designs
resized to nearby aspect ratios: foreground elements scale uniformly and
remain centered, while backgrounds fill the canvas.

For **Level 2**, it evaluates horizontal, vertical, and balanced layouts.
Grouped pieces move together, foreground images retain their proportions,
and text fits using the renderer's local brand fonts and wrapping rules.
Low-opacity decorative shapes keep their layering and are brought inside
the target. Candidate selection favors readable text, hierarchy, prominent
imagery, canvas usage, and source ordering. It uses no network or model at
runtime and never changes copy, font families, or image assets.

The layout rules use geometry and grouping, rather than sample IDs or target
resolutions. Extremely small targets use a best-effort proportional fallback;
text may be tiny or unable to fit, and foreground collisions may remain.
Level 3 optimization is not included.

Run the regression suite with the installed renderer dependencies:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## What the self-check does (and doesn't do)

`main.py` runs a quick structural check after every task — same element
`id`s as the source, required fields present, nothing off-canvas. **This
is not the official scorer.** It exists to catch obvious mistakes before
you waste a submission on them. See `RULES.md` for what's actually
checked and graded.

A self-check warning does not fail the run — your JSON and PNG are still
written either way. Read any warning before accepting an output. The Level 2
engine brings the sample's intentionally corner-bleeding decorative circle
inside the target, so its resized output should not produce that warning.

## The renderer

`main.py` calls `renderer/converter/convert.py`'s `render_design_to_png()`
(a vendored copy of `transformer-convertor`, wrapping `cr-renderer`) to
produce each task's PNG — already wired in, no setup needed. It reads
fonts/assets from `brand_kit/` and writes a real rendered preview, not a
placeholder. If you ever see plain labeled boxes instead of real text and
images in `output/*.png`, that means the import in `main.py` failed (e.g.
`cr-renderer` didn't install — check `requirements.txt` installed cleanly)
and it silently fell back to the box-and-label placeholder; don't judge
your layout quality by that fallback.

## Docker (how you'll actually be run)

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t my-chameleon-engine .
docker run --rm --network none \
  -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  my-chameleon-engine
```

`--network none` matches how stage-one scoring runs: everything your
engine needs must be installed at **build** time (add it to
`requirements.txt`), not fetched at run time. If you're using a locally
hosted model, bake its weights into the image during the build step.
